# Voter-Registration-Application-Code
CHALLENGE: 'Chase your voter registration application' 


A. electoral_register.py

Here's a Python code example using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to scrape the contact information for electoral registration offices from the UK Government website.

1. First, make sure you have the required libraries installed:
    
    pip install requests beautifulsoup4
    

2. Then, you can use the code to scrape the data

This code will:

1. Send a GET request to the specified URL.
2. Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
3. Find and extract the contact information from the parsed HTML. The exact tags and classes used in `soup.find_all` and other BeautifulSoup methods will depend on the actual structure of the webpage, which might need to be adjusted accordingly.

Make sure to adjust the tags and classes according to the actual HTML structure of the website you are scraping. The example assumes certain classes and tags, which you may need to update after inspecting the website's HTML.


B. electoral_register_postgres.py

To scrape the contact information from `https://www.gov.uk/contact-electoral-registration-office` and store it into a PostgreSQL database, you can use the `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `psycopg2` libraries. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Scrape the data using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
2. Store the scraped data into a PostgreSQL database using the `psycopg2` library.

First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 psycopg2-binary

### Explanation:

1. **Scrape the Data**:
   - Fetch the webpage using `requests`.
   - Parse the HTML content using `BeautifulSoup`.
   - Extract the required information (office name, address, phone, and email).

2. **Store the Data in PostgreSQL**:
   - Connect to the PostgreSQL database using `psycopg2`.
   - Create a table `electoral_offices` if it doesn't exist.
   - Insert the extracted data into the table.

Make sure to replace `your_database`, `your_user`, `your_password`, `localhost`, and `5432` with your actual PostgreSQL database credentials. Adjust the HTML parsing part based on the actual structure of the webpage.


C. electoral_register_cassandra.py

To scrape the contact information from `https://www.gov.uk/contact-electoral-registration-office` and store it into Apache Cassandra, you need to follow these steps:

1. Scrape the data using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
2. Store the scraped data into an Apache Cassandra database using the `cassandra-driver` library.

First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 cassandra-driver

### Explanation:

1. **Scrape the Data**:
   - Fetch the webpage using `requests`.
   - Parse the HTML content using `BeautifulSoup`.
   - Extract the required information (office name, address, phone, and email).

2. **Store the Data in Apache Cassandra**:
   - Connect to the Cassandra cluster.
   - Create a keyspace and table if they don't exist.
   - Prepare an `INSERT` statement and execute it for each office.

Ensure you have Apache Cassandra installed and running, and replace `'127.0.0.1'` with your Cassandra cluster address if different. Adjust the HTML parsing part based on the actual structure of the webpage.
